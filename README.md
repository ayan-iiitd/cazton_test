# cazton_test


- Theer are two `.ipynb` files present.
- One for collecting the data and the otehr for fine-tuning the model.
- The programs were run directly on the free version of Google Colab.
- Directly importing the files into Colab and running them should work.
- The only change that needs to be done is where to save the files.
  - In the `get data.ipynb` file, the cell at the beggining notes the main directory.
- Packages installed from `pip` that were not present in Colab: `datasets`, `evaluate`, `torch==2.0`, `peft`
